#### **A little bit about me**
I've always had a knack for making things, most of the times by breaking them. This continued for long enough to carry me through an engineering discipline. I'm a materials science major at BUET. Here I discovered the joy of making things without breaking them, almost, through programming. 

I started to write programms, moslty with bugs to automate little things. Moreover, I was always fascinated with games and how they work. Eventually, I made a few. It led me to many rabbit holes and soon discovered a differnet universe all together in programming. So, now I'm trying my best to understand its ins and outs.
